For each UAV, an embedded radar sensor can sense the distance to the nearby UAVs.
Moreover, each following UAV can communicate with the two other UAVs in the swarm, via wireless cellular links, to obtain information of the velocity and heading angle.
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can ﬂy autonomouslyor be remotely piloted by ground crews, and they can savelives when replacing humans in harmful environments. 
Typicalapplications of UAVs in such contexts include surveillance andreconnaissance 
Military surveillance drones typically communicate via satellites that have wide beam coverage so the aircraft always stays in the same footprint. 
 Newer satellites have multiple high-powered spot beams, each covering narrow geographic areas.
 Tethered drones are any drone physically connected to a power station on the ground. 
 There are variations of tethered drones, ranging from a standard drone tethered to the ground by using a regular fishing line, to programmed drones that use a specialized hardware tether.
 There are a number of technologies in development designed to thwart dangerous drones from entering no-fly zones or inflicting harm on civilians.
  Among them, radio frequency jamming, or “jammers”, can be used to disrupt the RF signal of the drone, causing it to fail.
